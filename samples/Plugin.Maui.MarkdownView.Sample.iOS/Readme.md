## Why this project?

This project initiates a platform-specific version of an app within another MAUI project with a SingleProject structure.

It has been created to be able to use the feature 'Multiple Startup projects' on a SingleProject structure, and gain the benefits of running multiple projects at the same time like using XAML Hot-Reload for multiple platforms simultaneously.
